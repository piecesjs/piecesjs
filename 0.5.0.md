# piecesjs v0.5.0 - TypeScript Support

> **Note:** I'm not a TypeScript developer, so I'm open to feedback and suggestions to improve the type definitions. If you see something that could be better, feel free to share your thoughts!

Hey everyone!
Just dropped piecesjs v0.5.0 with TypeScript support. Now you get autocomplete and type checking out of the box.

## TypeScript Definitions

All the main parts of piecesjs now have type definitions:

- `Piece` class with all its methods and properties
- `piecesManager` with its interfaces
- Utility functions like `load()` and `isNodeList()`

## Better Developer Experience

- **Autocomplete in your IDE** when using piecesjs
- **Type checking** to catch errors early
- **Generic types** for query methods so you can do `this.$<HTMLButtonElement>('button')`
- **Event types** are properly typed with `HTMLElementEventMap`

```typescript
import { Piece } from 'piecesjs';

class MyComponent extends Piece {
  mount(): void {
    const button = this.$<HTMLButtonElement>('button');
    // button is now typed as HTMLButtonElement | NodeList | null
  }
}
```

## How It Works

- Added `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration
- Created type definition files (`.d.ts`) in `src/types/`
- Types are built and included in the npm package
- All existing JavaScript code still works - this is fully backward compatible

## Build Process

Added a new `build:types` script that copies type definitions to `build/types/` so they're included when you install the package.

**Thanks to everyone using piecesjs for the feedback and support.**

Enjoy!
