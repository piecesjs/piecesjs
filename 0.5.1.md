# piecesjs v0.5.1 - Return Value for Call Method

Quick update to improve the `call()` method utility.

## Return Value for `call()`

The `call()` method now returns the value from the executed function. This allows you to get data back when calling methods on other pieces.

```javascript
// In your Piece
const result = this.call('someMethod', { foo: 'bar' }, 'OtherPiece');
console.log(result); // Now contains the return value of someMethod
```

## TypeScript Update

The TypeScript definition for `call()` has been updated to reflect this change, now correctly typing the return value.
